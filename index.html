              <p>Trust Grant provides grants or concessional loans to projects proposed by businesses which have the potential to solve a defined development issue.<br> Funding is awarded through an open competition, based on pre-defined criteria such as the potential
              for commercial viability, expected development outcomes, and an assessmen of whether the challenge fund subsidy is necessary for that project to proceed. <br>The business is typically required to match the donor funding, from private investors
              or internal resources. Challenge funds are used to address a wide range of development issues, including health, civil society, environment, and private sector development. This guide concentrates on private sector development challenge
              funds – often called ‘Enterprise Challenge Funds’ – which finance businesses in order to raise incomes, provide employment, and increase access to markets for the poor.<br>Many lessons contained in this guide are relevant for other forms
              of private public partnerships.

              <p>Technology is not about fancy and expensive high-end solutions. You can kick-start your technology journey by taking simple steps to automate existing processes and improve productivity. .Fund managers must find a practical balance by investing
              in a results measurement system which measures beyond outputs, validates self-reported results from businesses, and captures change in the wider market. The Trust Grant Standard can provide a framework to keep the system practical and cost-effective, by preventing fund managers from reinventing the wheel or measuring unnecessary indicators.
