<h2>Business Fund Grant</h2>
Small and medium business owners in the transportation industry, who are looking to expand their existing business, can avail up to $3,000 interest-free loans and up to $10,000 with low interest as seed funding. 
<p>Certain states also help SMEs in the tourism transport business sectors by providing them with incentives when they employ a new worker. Under this grant, business owners can claim up to $5,000 for each new trainee/apprentice/worker they have employed.</p>

To be eligible, the business must be:
    <ul>
   <li> must have a small /medium scale business in the transport industry</li>
   <li>must not be liable for payroll tax</li>
    <li>must be located in the state where the application is lodged</li>
    </ul>
There are certain States that encourage transportation business owners who also work as drivers to hire people to work for them so that the owners can take care of the business administrative affairs. In some states, a matched funding of up to $5,000 is provided to help small businesses access professional advice to improve their business. To be eligible, your business should be: no older than 4 years, have an ABN and have less than 20 employees.

Above-mentioned grants are only some of the many incentives that the Australian government has in place to support the growth of small and medium enterprises.
