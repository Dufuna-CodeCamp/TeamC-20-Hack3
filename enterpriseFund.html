        <h1>Enterprise Improvement Funds</h1>
        <hr><br>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p> provides grants or concessional loans to projects proposed by businesses which have the potential to solve a defined development issue. 4 Funding is awarded through an open competition, based on pre-defined criteria such as the potential for commercial
            viability, expected development outcomes, and an assessment of whether the challenge fund subsidy is necessary for that project to proceed. The business is typically required to match the donor funding, from private investors or internal resources.Enterprise
            Improvement Funds are used to address a wide range of development issues, including health, civil society, environment, and private sector development. This guide concentrates on private sector development challenge funds – often called ‘Enterprise
            Challenge Funds’ – which finance businesses in order to raise incomes, provide employment, and increase access to markets for the poor.
        </p>
        <p>Are you in need of funding in any form (equity, debts or other instruments) other than donation or grants? <br> The Business Process Improvement Grant is used to support short to medium term company projects that are designed to develop management
            capability and drive company efficiencies and business process improvements. Improvement projects must address a clear business need and deliver a positive impact on your business. Projects must also demonstrate the potential to develop the
            knowledge and skills of the company's management team.
        </p>
        <h3>Eligibility</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Be registered and operating in Nigeria;</li>
            <li>Your net working capital – that is, majorly inventory and debtors, less creditors</li>
            <li>Have no government debts which is , inclusive of tax liabilities(NI/Tax/VAT etc) and no contingent debts </li>

        </ul>
        <div>
            <h3>Requirement</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop a clear results measurement system: Make results measurement responsibilities clear from the beginning. Key requirements, such as reporting against indicators and hosting site visits, should be specified in the contract with the
                    grantee. This ensures that the business understands the challenge fund’s expectations, and is contractually required to deliver. It is worth investing extra resources to develop an effective results measurement system at the beginning
                    of the challenge fund, as changes require additional time to understand and use.
                </li>
                <li>Make results measurement useful for the business:Businesses are often interested in results measurement, for three reasons. Firstly, businesses are frequently keen to learn new ways of keeping track of their activities and outputs. Secondly,
                    monitoring the results of their work helps to strengthen their own value chains, improving their understanding of their customers and suppliers.
                </li>

                <li>Clearly and consistently define indicators:If indicators are given different definitions in different contexts, then it will not be meaningful to aggregate them.Consequently, it is vital to ensure that indicators are consistently defined,
                    and this is clearly communicated to the companies or staff who measure them. These indicators contain standardised definitions of indicators, designed to promote comparison between businesses.The more similar projects are, the more
                    meaningful it is to aggregate indicators

                </li>
                <li>Take a portfolio approach:The success of a challenge fund depends on the portfolio, not any individual project. It is expected that some business ideas will fail, and lessons can be learnt from failures as well as successes. 10 Similarly,
                    the challenge fund can monitor some projects in more depth than others. Faced with resource limitations, it may be more effective to prioritise monitoring of more expensive, successful, or innovative business projects.</li>
